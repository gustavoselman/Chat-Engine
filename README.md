# Chat project ðŸ’¬

In my quest to create an engaging and fast chat experience, I came across a powerful tool known as Chat Engine. Using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend, I incorporated Chat Engine into this project, simplifying the process of creating an elegant and responsive chat app.
